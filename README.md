# Real World Testing in Rust

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/jdortiz/real-world-testing-rustconf2024/)

## This Repo

This repository contains the code used in the "Real World Testing in Rust" as delivered for RustConf 2024.

You’ve probably heard about the importance of unit testing your code. You may already know the theory and you would want
to give it a try, beyond testing a function that adds two numbers. But it is hard to walk this path alone since the
first tests are also the hardest. This hands-on workshop takes a different approach. We will use a REST API implemented
with Axum that stores data and talks to the network. Learn the concepts and use the de-facto standard tools and crates
to write actual tests for a realistic application. Reach the top of the Unit Test Mountain!

You can use this code in your system or spin up a codespace from this repo. There are commits for each of the stages of
the workshop that are available in the `develop` branch. `main' just contains the starting point for the workshop.
